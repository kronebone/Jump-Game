# Jumper
A simple jumping game using pygame. Try to stay alive as long as possible and get points doing so. You have 2 jumps and jumps are 
replenished when you touch a platform. Avoid touching the bouncing boxes and try not to fall through the bottom, you will take damage from both.

- xbox360 controller support (others may work but only x360 controller has been tested)

Future:
- high score tracking
- main menu
- background img
- music
